----- Goal: Break in to my own account 

----- Mini Problems:
1. Connecting to website using golang script or python (prefereably golang)
2. Coding up a loop that will for 000000 to 999999 and break out when correct combination is found
    - Submit possible combination


------ Pseudo-code:

create variable "guess" == 000000

while guess != 999999:
    ++guess
    submit guess

    if submission == valid:
        exit
